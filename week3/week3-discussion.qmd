### Example 1

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: "A stacked histogram of penguin body masses per species where Gentoo has the highest average body mass (in g) over Adelie and Chinstrap species by x percent/ x grams."

library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body masses")
```
## Example 2: NYT

![Monthly Global Temperature by Year ](week3-discussion_files/nyt-monthly-temp.png){fig-alt="Dot plot of monthly global temperature by year from 1850 to 2023 compared to the 20th century average. From 1975 onward, the yearly temperature is hotter than average, whereas prior to 1975 the temperature was cooler than average."}

## Example 3: Chapman et al. 2024
